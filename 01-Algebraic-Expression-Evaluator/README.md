# Algebraic Expression Evaluator

Build a command-line calculator that evaluates expressions like `"2 + 3 * (4 - 1)"` using stacks for parentheses and operator precedence. This reinforces PEMDAS rules and teaches parsing logic. Start with infix notation; output the result. (Math benefit: Practice algebraic manipulation; C++: String manipulation with `std::string` and `std::stack`.)
